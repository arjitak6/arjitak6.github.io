<p>
 You are a sweet and cute cat
<br>
I feel proud to have you as my friend
<br>
But Actually
<br>
You are more important to me than just a friend
<br>
We know each other since first day of school life
<br>
And
<br>
I will always try to keep you happy and smiling
<br>
I hope whenever you will see this site,
<br>
You will remember that very mad person who coded this
